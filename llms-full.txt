## What is VYBZ?

VYBZ is a location-first social app for meeting people around you. In real life, in real time. Whether you're in your dorm, in class, or at your favourite hangout, VYBZ shows you who's nearby, what's happening, and lets you jump into conversations tied to real places.

The app is built around one dynamic feed that adapts to where you are and how many people are around. It works for quick moments right here, right now, or for seeing what's going on in your area. Explore who's nearby, share what you're up to, and turn those moments into real connections.

### Core Concept

VYBZ bridges the gap between online and offline social interaction. Instead of endless scrolling through curated content, VYBZ connects you with real people in real places, right now.

## Key Features

### 2. Neighbourhood Feed

### 3. Map View
Visual pins on a map showing where people are and what they're doing. Discover busy spots and interesting conversations nearby.

### 4. Direct Messaging
Connect with people you meet through the app. Start conversations that began at a location and continue them anywhere.

Verified local businesses can create profiles, post updates, and engage with customers who are actually at or near their location.
