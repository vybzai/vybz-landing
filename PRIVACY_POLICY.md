Our Privacy Policy Written in a Friendly Language

## Information We Collect

There are three basic categories of information we collect:
1. Information you provide.
2. Information we get when you use our services.
3. Information we get from third parties.

Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.

### Information You Provide

When you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a VYBZ account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, gender, phone number, and date of birth and also social media account information from services such as Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter. We may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar.

You’ll also provide us whatever information you send through our services, such as posts, messages, media, and other types of content. Keep in mind that the users who view your messages, posts, and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.

When you contact us for support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information that you volunteer to provide us or that we need to resolve your question.

### Information We Get When You Use Our Services

When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you viewed a particular neighborhood feed, joined a specific location feed for a certain period of time, and sent messages or posts. These are the types of information we collect when you use our services:

*   **Usage Information.** We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:
    *   how you interact with our services, such as which neighborhood feeds you joined, posts you viewed or interacted with on VYBZ, which Tabloids you viewed or interacted with, which location feeds you have joined or interacted with, or which search queries you submit.
    *   how you communicate with other VYBZ users, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your crew/connections, which crew/connections you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).
*   **Content Information.** We collect content you create on our services.
*   **Device Information.** We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:
    *   information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, battery level, and time zone;
    *   information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones, and whether you have headphones connected; and
    *   information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.
*   **Device Phonebook.** we may—with your permission—collect information from your device’s phonebook.
*   **Camera and Photos.** Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to make certain posts or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.
*   **Location Information.** When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.
*   **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.** Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as advertising and commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services.

    *   access times;
    *   pages viewed;
    *   IP address;
    *   identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser; and
    *   pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.

### Information We Collect from Third Parties

We may collect information about you from other users, and third parties. Here are a few examples:

We use your information to provide you with great experiences, products and services that we work to improve. Here are the ways we do that:
*   develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services.

## How We Share Information

We may share information about you in the following ways:

### With other VYBZ users

We may share the following information with other VYBZ users:
*   information about you, such as your username, name, Bitmoji, your Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter usernames or user handles.
*   information about how you have interacted with our services, such as your progress bar “score,” the names of VYBZ users you are friends with, and other information that will help VYBZ users understand your connections with others using our services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new crew request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have VYBZ Crew members in common.
*   any additional information you have directed us to share. For example, using third-party login.

### With all VYBZ users

We may share the following information with all VYBZ users as well as with our business partners and the general public:
*   public information like your name, username, profile identifier and profile pictures.
*   Tabloid submissions that are set to be public and any content that you submit to an inherently public service, like Neighborhood Feeds, Crew Feeds and Location Feeds. This content may be viewed and shared by the public at large both on and off our services, including through search results, on websites, in apps, and in online and offline broadcasts.

### With third parties

*   We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, including to measure and optimize the performance of ads and deliver more relevant ads, including on third-party websites and apps.
*   We may share information about you with business partners that provide services and functionality on our services.
*   We may share information about you, such as device and usage information, to help us and others prevent fraud.
*   We may share information about you for legal, safety, and security reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
    *   comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.
    *   investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations.
    *   protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.
    *   detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.
*   We may share information about you as part of a merger or acquisition. If VYBZ Inc. gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.
*   We may also share with third parties that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us aggregated, non-personally identifiable, or de-identified information.

## Third-Party Content and Integrations

Our services may contain third-party content and integrations. We are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.

## How Long We Keep Your Information

Most messages—like Posts and Chats—sent in VYBZ will be stored by default on our servers. Other content, like direct messages, Tabloid Content, Activity notifications are stored by default on our servers. Unless otherwise specified by VYBZ Inc., or a valid user request.

We store other information for longer periods of time. For example:
*   We store your basic account information—like your name, phone number, and email address—and list of friends until you ask us to delete them.
*   We store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use. For example, if you use the Map, we store information about your favorite places indefinitely so we can personalize and improve your experience.
*   We’re constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike, so we can provide you with more relevant content.

If you ever decide to stop using VYBZ, you can just ask us to delete your account. We’ll also delete most of the information we’ve collected about you after you’ve been inactive for a while—but don’t worry, we’ll try to contact you first!

Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. There may be legal requirements to store your data and we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your account or content created by you is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.

## Control Over Your Information

We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.

*   **Revoking permissions.** In most cases, if you let us use your information, you can simply revoke your permission by changing the settings in the app or on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
*   **Deletion.** You can also delete some information in the app, like photos posted to Neighborhood, Crew or Location feeds, Tabloid submissions, and messages, replies, emoji reactions, and certain search history.

## Users in the European Union

If you’re a user in the European Union, you should know that VYBZ Inc. is the controller of your personal information. Here is some additional information we would like to bring to your attention:

### Rights of Access, Deletion, Correction, and Portability

You can exercise your rights of access, deletion, correction, and portability as described in the section above.

### Bases for Using Your Information

Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called “legal bases” and, at VYBZ, we typically rely on one of two:

1.  **Contract.** One reason we might use your information is because you’ve entered into an agreement with us.
2.  **Legitimate interest.** Another reason we might use your information is because we have—or a third party has—a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we need to use your information to provide and improve our services, including protecting your account, delivering your messages or posts, providing customer support, and helping you find local VYBZ users and content we think you’ll like. Because all of our services are free, we also may use some information about you to try and show you ads you’ll find interesting.
